# About

This is a crypto tracker-manager prototype SPA ([Single-page-application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA))  I've been working on as a motivation to learn the various popular frontend JavaScript frameworks. I started in [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com), then re-wrote it in [Polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org), and then [React](https://reactjs.org). This is my latest iteration which I've implemented in [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

## Live Demo
https://BitTracker.netlify.app

## Serve Locally
> To view the web app from [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org)'s [local dev server](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/cli-service.html#vue-cli-service-serve), just copy and paste this [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) command into your terminal...
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ashmichael/bt-vue.git && cd bt-vue && npm install && npm run start
```
