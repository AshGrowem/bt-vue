# BitTracker.app [prototype]

This is a prototype web app I've been working on as a motivation to learn the various popular front-end Javascript frameworks (Polymer, React & Vue). I started in [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/), then re-wrote it in [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), then [React](https://reactjs.org/), then back to Polymer. This is now my latest iteration which I've written using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

## Quick Start
> If you would like to view the web app, just copy and paste this into your terminal...
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ashrafhadden/bt-vue.git && npm install && npm run start
```
