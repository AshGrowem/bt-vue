# BitTracker.app [prototype]

This is a prototype website I've been working on as a motivation to learn the various popular Javascript frameworks (React, Vue, & Polymer). I started in [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/), then re-wrote it in Polymer, then React, then back to Polymer. This is now my latest iteration which I've written using Vue.

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ashrafhadden/bt-vue.git && npm install && npm run start
```
